0:00-2:15
Igor: People here, yeah, let’s have one more minute for people to join and then we can start.

Ricardo: There are some people in vacation.

Igor: Yeah some are vacationing, there are some few people who are just ill because of springtime.

Ricardo: yeah, I had my time some weeks ago

Igor: Yeah me too, 

Ricardo: But my problem I guess is too much coffee, not any infections.

Igor: That also happens, so just give me a few more seconds and we’ll start.

Iuri: You guys can hear me ?

Igor: Yeah yeah.

Igor: So yeh, I guess let’s get started then, thank you everyone for joining, it’s meeting number 17, it’s the one that been postponed from the last time and yeah and then yep basically today there are not that many topics to discuss but can start with a swarm updates as usual so just give me a few seconds to open an active swarms list yeah so I guess we can start with the sticker market and yeah, sticker market, If there is

# Sticker Market
2:16-2:52
Julien: I can do that, not a lot of news from sticker market on from development side we’ve done pretty much anything that’s required so not a lot to expect and we are still in the process of doing the audits which I believe started, well I am not very sure because it’s kind of complex to follow the contractor deeds so I'm not quite sure about that but yeah not a lot own on sticker market front.

2:53-3:58
Igor: Yeah Thank you so then the next one is Tribute To Talk but I don't see like Eric or anyone from there here today. Derek’s on vacation right or something like that, yeah then let’s switch to Dapp store, are there any news on this front so I know that we launched the, we released the first version with it but are there any other things, okay and then yeah let's go to the tellar network, yes Iuri’s here atleast

# The Teller Network, Embark, DAO
3:59- 5:42

Iuri: So, supposed to say what to one week two weeks, so with, I mean we did some security audits of our own just like a pre-review so to speak with the different tools of whirlwind and  embark.
 We implemented, we fixed the issues that we were having. We did two RnDs, one was on state channeling  Staters and the other one was in the POA  sidechain to use with the teller network and we also we adopted the whole thing to desktop because it was only mobile before and we had the whole workflow and UI for also the arbiter and we did the first like actual like intensive test of the application like with different people in different parts of the world just you know to see what were the issues on what to improve and so and I guess I can go next to the DAO stuff and with DAO we asked we are (adding) this feature to supporting listening projects and it fetches the project from IPFS and all that we also did like a more intensive test and from the bunch of issues that were currently working on fixing and I think that’s it for now.

# Core Improvements
5:43-6:49
Igor: yeah, cool, thank you, is anyone here from the Token Economics swarm ? Barry here ? Sub sectors..ok next is core improvements that so for the last few weeks we did release new version and we are playing series A follow-up to this with one more bug fix that we feel like its important and status go side as well we are currently, like working on error reporting in a more private way so people can actually send logs and they will be offered to send blogs to status on exceptions and things like that so that's very important for us to actually debug the application and after that we'll do like UI,sware , performance improvements I think. So the next one is the protocol.

Petty: Hey Igor, I have an update for the Token economics forum

# Token Economics
6:50- 7:32
Igor: Oh cool, yeah 
Petty: That’s where we’ve got the build materials I’m working on the initial like introduction blog posts as well as we're playing around with a few different ways to visualize the ENS usernames contract and people's interaction with it so that it can be explained easier to the general  public while also showing like how it captures value and that'll be where I hope to have that at least like majordraft being revised by the end of the week and then from there won't go into each of the individual use cases and notebooks that there's made for additional articles to create kind of a corpus of material to kind of market around.



# Protocol Research
7:33- 9:32
Igor: Cool, thank you so much, now Protocol and Oskar, yes 
Oskar: Yeah sure, so let’s see, last week..ish so we’ve been implementing this minimal viable data sync proof of concept in go and this has been working at, its sort of working interactively but there’s some cleanup that we have to do to get it running in this sort of console client and so we can go, still looking into a bit of the minimal requirements and we’ll make sure we have a way that we can upgrade things which helpful for more efficient sync based on bloom filters and these are the things and that I'm going to research also been looking in sort of , no I don't know if this was talked about last time but one of the things that we need to solve before launching version one is sort of this bandwidth consumption and ideally with compatibility so one step towards that is that we need to have to partition whisper topics soon and we had some discussions with Andreas sort of start sketching out the proposal for moving to device based sync as opposed to suppose to multi cost-based and that will also tie into how we actually adopt the data sync stuff into the app and how we can do later on do protocol negotiation and these types of things adding that we have this ongoing bi-weekly calls and trying to cooperate a bit with this one team it's gonna be a summit in a few weeks that a few of us are going to, yeah and I think that’s mostly it.

I forgot exactly what to be updated last time but something like this.

# Janitors
9:33- 10:33
Igor: Thank you Oskar, and for Janitors ? maybe Hesther or ..
Oskar: yeah
Hesther: Yeah I can...oh Oskar, feel free to go ahead , I was gonna give an update that we made some progress on the critical path that is in right so I do believe most people do have a bank account if you go to the top folder, let’s say projects, you’ll see 8 projects that is called critical path or has some something referring to critical path if you go into that task you can see all the dependencies that we defined so far as being critical I would say that's the main update, Oskar anything to add ?

Oskar: No I think that’s pretty good for now.

# Democracy (DAO)
10:34- 12:22
Igor: Great, so Ricrdo if you can talk... and then topic democracy but if not then we can skip it and not..
Ricardo:  Yeah, I'm doing so more research on (inaudible) because I have two types of quorum that is the simple quorum and the majority quorum and for the wicked  democracy  it seems that it doesn't make sense to have these delegates or at least default to delegate for these simple quorums because they don't require the majority so it's just how you would say they online my majority just the people who voted that counts and so I would I'm removing this part of topic democracy to a later iteration and I will focus only on the majority quorums because that's the.. I think the most important ones and then later on I would derive from that to make a simple quorum I'm also still trying to talk with Aaragon but seems like there is not many interests at their parts or I’m not too really sure so like lot like many answers about my questions but yeah in about today they react components,  that's really being slow and that's so I expect to get in the rhythm back again to make the components this week but I was mostly on this research 

  
# Teams

12:23-
Igor: Yeah, Thank you Ricardo, then then I guess we would do some teams update so for the new core UI is there anyone to talk about ? Looks like there isn’t one 

Oskar: Is (inaudible) or Rachel here ?
Igor: No I don’t see neither of them,
